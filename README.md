While AceTalk may not be as feature-heavy as other mainstream messengers, it is a platform that prioritizes your experience over complexity. It features a minimalist interface inspired by the classic Skype aesthetic, utilizing a P2P system to keep your conversations truly anonymous.

According to the philosophy of AceTalk, everyone should be able to communicate anonymously and without doubt. I will continue to develop AceTalk as much as possible in future versions.

I hope you enjoy it! :)
